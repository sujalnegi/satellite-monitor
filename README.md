## Features

* **Real-Time Satellite Tracking:**
    * **Live Orbital Visualization:** Track satellites like ISS, Hubble, and GOES in real-time using TLE (Two-Line Element) data.
    * **3D Earth Model:** Beautiful rotating Earth with realistic textures and lighting.
    * **Moon Visualization:** Accurate Moon positioning and orbital mechanics.
* **Interactive 3D Model Viewer:**
    * **Satellite Models Gallery:** Explore detailed 3D models of famous satellites (ISS, Hubble, GOES).
    * **360° Rotation:** Fully interactive camera controls with zoom, pan, and rotate.
    * **Grid Reference:** a gird mat to give a more 3D look to models.
* **Advanced Simulation Controls:**
    * **Time Control:** Adjust simulation speed from 0.1x to 10x. (1x = 1 hour/second)

## Local Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+
* `pip` (Python package installer)
* Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sujalnegi/satellite-monitor.git
cd satellite-monitor
```

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python libraries using `pip`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can start the Flask development server:

```bash
python app.py
```

Now, open your web browser and navigate to the following address:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

You should see the **Satellite Tracker** application running!

## How to Use

### Main Simulation Page
1. Navigate to the **Simulation** page from the home screen.
2. Select a satellite from the dropdown menu (ISS, Hubble, GOES, etc.).
3. Use the **speed slider** to adjust simulation speed.
4. Click **Pause/Play** to control time flow.
5. Try the **Reverse Time** feature to watch satellites orbit backwards.
6. Use **zoom controls** (+/-) to adjust your view.

### 3D Model Viewer
1. Click **"Explore 3D Models"** from the home page.
2. Select a satellite model to view in detail.
3. Use your mouse to rotate, zoom, and pan around the model.
4. Click **"Launching Pad"** to return to the main page.

### Custom Satellite Upload
1. In the simulation, click **"➕ Add Custom Satellite"** in the control panel.
2. Select a GLB file from your computer.
3. Click **"Add Satellite"** to upload.
4. Your custom satellite (UFO) will appear with a **red orbit line**.
5. Select "UFO" from the dropdown to track your custom satellite.

### Camera Controls
- **Mouse Drag:** Rotate camera around Earth
- **Scroll Wheel:** Zoom in/out
- **Right Click + Drag:** Pan camera
- **Reset View:** Click the reset button when tracking a satellite
- **Switch View:** Toggle between Earth and satellite perspectives
